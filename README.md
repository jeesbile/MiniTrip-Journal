# 🌍 Mini Trip Journal

This is my **first React app**, built as part of my journey to learn frontend development.

It’s a **fictional travel journal** app — each entry shows a destination with an image, country, travel dates, and description. I didn’t visit these places — I just used sample data to practice building React components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React
- 💨 Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ Vite
- 🗺️ React Icons

---

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic rendering using props and data mapping
- Clean card layout with image + content
- Responsive and styled using Tailwind
- Uses separate component files (Header, ArticleCard, data.js)

---

## 📚 Why I Built This

This is my **first real app** built with React.  
I used it to practice important concepts like:
- Passing props between components
- Rendering components from an array using `.map()`
- Creating layout with Flexbox and Tailwind
- Setting up and pushing a project to GitHub

Pushed to GitHub on **July 20, 2025** — a big milestone in my React learning journey 🚀
